# Titanic_Survival_Prediction

In order to successfully run this, Python environment is needed and then all those packages/libraries we used.
Anaconda environment does all the work without hassle. Install it and then open Jupyter Notebook.
This project in Machine Learning is about prediction based on the data from kaggle that whether survived or not.
 If you aren't able to figure out how to do it then please contact. I will be glad to explain in detail.
